# Project 1: Classifying and Analysing Cyberbullying-Related Tweets using Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence Methods 
# Cyberbullying has become a growing concern with the widespread use of social media platforms. This study aims to detect cyberbullying-related tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and prompt-engineering Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset contained tweets labeled by types of cyberbullying including gender, ethnicity, religion, age and not-cyberbullying. Traditional ML models such as Logistic Regression, a deep learning model BiLSTM, transformer-based model BERT and large language model GPT were applied and compared. Results showed that BERT achieved the highest overall accuracy and F1-scores, while simpler models performed well on explicit, keyword-driven tweets. GPT models improved drastically in few-shot scenarios. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling provided additional insights into the linguistic and thematic patterns of cyberbullying. The study highlights the value of combining contextual and statistical approaches for improving automatic detection of harmful content online.
